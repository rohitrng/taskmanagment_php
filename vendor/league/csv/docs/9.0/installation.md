## Manual Install

You can also use `League\Csv` without using Composer by downloading the library on Github.

2. Find the release of `League\Csv` for your version of PHP.
3. Click the **Source Code** link for preferred compression format.

The library is compatible with any [PSR-4](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/) compatible autoloader.

Also, `League\Csv` comes bundled with its own autoloader script `autoload.php` located in the root directory.

```php
use League\Csv\Reader;
use League\Csv\Writer;

require '/path/to/league/csv/autoload.php';

// Your script starts here
// ...
```

where `path/to/league/csv` represents the path where the library was extracted.
